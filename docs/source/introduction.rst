CombiCSP Project Documentation
==============================

Introduction
------------

CombiCSP is an open-source software tool designed for the dynamic modelling of concentrating solar energy power plants. It combines solar resource data, system engineering inputs, and financial tools to provide dynamic simulations and annual yields for solar power plants. The software supports models based on solar power tower and parabolic trough collectors, and it's extendable to include novel approaches and analyses in solar energy modelling.

Relevant Research Work
----------------------

The software is associated with significant research in the field of concentrating solar power. More information on the relevant work can be found in the published paper: `https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119450`.

Quick Start
-----------

While installation and specific usage instructions are detailed separately, it's worth noting that CombiCSP can be installed via pip in a new environment or by cloning the repository and using setuptools. The repository can be found at `https://github.com/npapnet/Combi_CSP.git`.

Example Usage
-------------

CombiCSP includes several example scripts demonstrating its capabilities:

- `CSPCret.py`: Analysis of heliostat and CSP power and energy outputs in a location in Crete, Greece.
- `CSP50Compare.py`: Combined heliostat and CSP power and energy outputs comparison for a location in Crete, Greece.

The `Combi_CSP_oop.ipynb` notebook provides a typical use case scenario for the software.

Developers
----------

The CombiCSP project has been developed by:

- G. E. Arnaoutakis: Responsible for technical direction and original calculation functions.
- N. Papadakis: In charge of software design and package maintenance.
